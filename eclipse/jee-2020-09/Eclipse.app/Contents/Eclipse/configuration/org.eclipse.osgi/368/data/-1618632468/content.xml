        <property name='df_LT.license' value='International License Agreement for Early Release of Programs&#xA;&#xA;Part 1 - General Terms&#xA;&#xA;BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, CLICKING ON AN &quot;ACCEPT&quot; BUTTON, OR OTHERWISE USING THE PROGRAM, LICENSEE AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND LICENSEE TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS,&#xA;&#xA;* DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, CLICK ON AN &quot;ACCEPT&quot; BUTTON, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND&#xA;&#xA;* PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED MEDIA AND DOCUMENTATION TO IBM. IF THE PROGRAM WAS DOWNLOADED, DESTROY ALL COPIES OF THE PROGRAM.&#xA;&#xA;1. Definitions&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Authorized Use&quot; - the specified level at which Licensee is authorized to execute or run the Program. That level may be measured by number of users, millions of service units (&quot;MSUs&quot;), Processor Value Units (&quot;PVUs&quot;), or other level of use specified by IBM.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Early Release&quot; - a release of a Program for purposes of testing prior to it being made commercially available that may still be under development and therefore, potentially unreliable.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;IBM&quot; - International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;License Information&quot; (&quot;LI&quot;) - a document that provides information and any additional terms specific to a Program. The Program&apos;s LI can be found in the Program&apos;s directory, by the use of a system command, or as a booklet included with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; - the following, including the original and all whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, files, and modules, 3) audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), and 4) related licensed materials (such as keys and documentation).&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Test Period&quot; - the period during which the Licensee tests a Program that has not been made commercially available to customers.&#xA;&#xA;2. Agreement Structure&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms (if any) and the LI and is the complete agreement between Licensee and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any prior oral or written communications between Licensee and IBM concerning Licensee&apos;s use of the Program. The terms of Part 2 may replace or modify those of Part 1. To the extent of any conflict, the LI prevails over both Parts.&#xA;&#xA;3. License Grant&#xA;&#xA;The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold.&#xA;&#xA;IBM grants Licensee a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable license to 1) download, install, and use the Program during the Test Period up to the Authorized Use specified in the LI solely for test purposes and to provide feedback to IBM and 2) make a backup copy, all provided that&#xA;&#xA;a. Licensee has lawfully obtained the Program and complies with the terms of this Agreement;&#xA;&#xA;b. the backup copy does not execute unless the backed-up Program cannot execute;&#xA;&#xA;c. Licensee reproduces all copyright notices and other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy, of the Program;&#xA;&#xA;d. Licensee maintains a record of all copies of the Program and ensures that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or remotely) 1) does so only on Licensee&apos;s behalf and 2) complies with the terms of this Agreement;&#xA;&#xA;e. Licensee does not 1) use the Program for productive purposes or otherwise use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, otherwise translate, or reverse engineer the Program, except as expressly permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; 3) use any of the Program&apos;s components, files, modules, audio-visual content, or related licensed materials separately from that Program; 4) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program; or 5) use the Program for commercial application hosting; and&#xA;&#xA;f. if Licensee obtains this Program as a Supporting Program, Licensee uses this Program only to support the Principal Program and subject to any limitations in the license to the Principal Program, or, if Licensee obtains this Program as a Principal Program, Licensee uses all Supporting Programs only to support this Program, and subject to any limitations in this Agreement. For purposes of this Item &quot;f,&quot; a &quot;Supporting Program&quot; is a Program that is part of another IBM Program (&quot;Principal Program&quot;) and identified as a Supporting Program in the Principal Program&apos;s LI. (To obtain a separate license to a Supporting Program without these restrictions, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained the Supporting Program.)&#xA;&#xA;This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes.&#xA;&#xA;3.1 Updates, Fixes, and Patches&#xA;&#xA;When Licensee receives an update, fix, or patch to a Program, Licensee accepts any additional or different terms that are applicable to such update, fix, or patch that are specified in its LI. If no additional or different terms are provided, then the update, fix, or patch is subject solely to this Agreement. If the Program is replaced by an update, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the replaced Program.&#xA;&#xA;3.2 Term and Termination&#xA;&#xA;The Test Period begins on the date Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement and ends upon the earliest of 1) the end of the duration or the date specified by IBM in either the License Information or a transaction document, 2) the date on which the Program automatically disables itself, or 3) the date on which IBM makes the Program commercially available. Licensee&apos;s license to the Program terminates at the end of the Test Period, and Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the Program and destroy all of Licensee&apos;s copies of the Program within 10 days of the end of the Test Period.&#xA;&#xA;IBM may terminate Licensee&apos;s license if Licensee fails to comply with the terms of this Agreement. If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of and destroy all of Licensee&apos;s copies of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;THE PROGRAM MAY CONTAIN A DISABLING DEVICE THAT WILL PREVENT IT FROM BEING USED AFTER THE TEST PERIOD ENDS. LICENSEE AGREES NOT TO TAMPER WITH THE DISABLING DEVICE OR THE PROGRAM. LICENSEE SHOULD TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT WHEN THE PROGRAM CAN NO LONGER BE USED.&#xA;&#xA;4. Charges&#xA;&#xA;There is no charge for the use of the Program for the duration of the Test Period.&#xA;&#xA;5. Rights in Data&#xA;&#xA;Licensee assigns to IBM all right, title, and interest (including ownership of copyright) in any data, suggestions, or written materials that 1) are related to the Program and 2) Licensee provides to IBM. Upon IBM&apos;s request, Licensee will sign additional documents necessary to assign such rights. In addition to the foregoing, Licensee grants to IBM a non-exclusive, irrevocable, unrestricted, worldwide and paid-up right and license to a) include in any product or service any idea, know-how, concept, technique, invention, discovery or improvement, whether or not patentable, that Licensee provides to IBM related to the Program b) use, manufacture and market any such product or service, and c) allow others to do any of the foregoing.&#xA;&#xA;6. No Warranties&#xA;&#xA;SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE PROGRAM OR SUPPORT, IF ANY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND TITLE, AND ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF NON-INFRINGEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED BY LAW. NO WARRANTIES APPLY AFTER THAT PERIOD. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. LICENSEE MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.&#xA;&#xA;THE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION 6 ALSO APPLY TO ANY OF IBM&apos;S PROGRAM DEVELOPERS AND SUPPLIERS.&#xA;&#xA;MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIERS, OR PUBLISHERS OF NON-IBM PROGRAMS MAY PROVIDE THEIR OWN WARRANTIES.&#xA;&#xA;IBM DOES NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT OF ANY KIND, UNLESS IBM SPECIFIES OTHERWISE. IN SUCH EVENT, ANY SUPPORT PROVIDED BY IBM IS SUBJECT TO THE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION 6.&#xA;&#xA;7. Licensee Data and Databases&#xA;&#xA;To assist Licensee in isolating the cause of a problem with the Program, IBM may request that Licensee 1) allow IBM to remotely access Licensee&apos;s system or 2) send Licensee information or system data to IBM. However, IBM is not obligated to provide such assistance unless IBM and Licensee enter a separate written agreement under which IBM agrees to provide to Licensee that type of support, which is beyond IBM&apos;s obligations in this Agreement. In any event, IBM uses information about errors and problems to improve its products and services, and assist with its provision of related support offerings. For these purposes, IBM may use IBM entities and subcontractors (including in one or more countries other than the one in which Licensee is located), and Licensee authorizes IBM to do so.&#xA;&#xA;Licensee remains responsible for 1) any data and the content of any database Licensee makes available to IBM, 2) the selection and implementation of procedures and controls regarding access, security, encryption, use, and transmission of data (including any personally-identifiable data), and 3) backup and recovery of any database and any stored data. Licensee will not send or provide IBM access to any personally-identifiable information, whether in data or any other form, and will be responsible for reasonable costs and other amounts that IBM may incur relating to any such information mistakenly provided to IBM or the loss or disclosure of such information by IBM, including those arising out of any third party claims.&#xA;&#xA;8. Limitation of Liability&#xA;&#xA;The limitations and exclusions in this Section 8 (Limitation of Liability) apply to the full extent they are not prohibited by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver.&#xA;&#xA;8.1 Items for Which IBM May Be Liable&#xA;&#xA;Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM&apos;s part or other liability, Licensee is entitled to recover damages from IBM. Regardless of the basis on which Licensee is entitled to claim damages from IBM (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort claim), IBM&apos;s entire liability for all claims in the aggregate arising from or related to each Program or otherwise arising under this Agreement will not exceed the amount of any 1) damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property and 2) other actual direct damages up to U.S. $10,000 (or equivalent in local currency).&#xA;&#xA;This limit also applies to any of IBM&apos;s Program developers and suppliers. It is the maximum for which IBM and its Program developers and suppliers are collectively responsible.&#xA;&#xA;8.2 Items for Which IBM Is Not Liable&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY:&#xA;&#xA;a. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;&#xA;&#xA;b. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR&#xA;&#xA;c. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.&#xA;&#xA;9. Compliance Verification&#xA;&#xA;For purposes of this Section 9 (Compliance Verification), &quot;Early Release Program Terms&quot; means 1) this Agreement and applicable amendments and transaction documents provided by IBM, and 2) IBM software policies that may be found at the IBM Software Policy website (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), including but not limited to those policies concerning backup, sub-capacity pricing, and migration.&#xA;&#xA;The rights and obligations set forth in this Section 9 remain in effect during the period the Program is licensed to Licensee, and for two years thereafter.&#xA;&#xA;9.1 Verification Process&#xA;&#xA;Licensee agrees to create, retain, and provide to IBM and its auditors accurate written records, system tool outputs, and other system information sufficient to provide auditable verification that Licensee&apos;s use of all Programs is in compliance with the Early Release Program Terms, including, without limitation, all of IBM&apos;s applicable licensing and pricing qualification terms. Licensee is responsible for 1) ensuring that it does not exceed its Authorized Use, and 2) remaining in compliance with Early Release Program Terms.&#xA;&#xA;Upon reasonable notice, IBM may verify Licensee&apos;s compliance with Early Release Program Terms at all sites and for all environments in which Licensee uses (for any purpose) Programs subject to Early Release Program Terms. Such verification will be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee&apos;s business, and may be conducted on Licensee&apos;s premises, during normal business hours. IBM may use an independent auditor to assist with such verification, provided IBM has a written confidentiality agreement in place with such auditor.&#xA;&#xA;9.2 Resolution&#xA;&#xA;IBM will notify Licensee in writing if any such verification indicates that Licensee has used any Program in excess of its Authorized Use or is otherwise not in compliance with the Early Release Program Terms. Licensee agrees to promptly pay directly to IBM the charges that IBM specifies in an invoice for 1) any such excess use, 2) support for such excess use for the lesser of the duration of such excess use or two years, and 3) any additional charges and other liabilities determined as a result of such verification.&#xA;&#xA;10. Third Party Notices&#xA;&#xA;The Program may include third party code that IBM, not the third party, licenses to Licensee under this Agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party code (&quot;Third Party Notices&quot;) are included for Licensee&apos;s information only. These notices can be found in the Program&apos;s NOTICES file(s). Information on how to obtain source code for certain third party code can be found in the Third Party Notices. If in the Third Party Notices IBM identifies third party code as &quot;Modifiable Third Party Code,&quot; IBM authorizes Licensee to 1) modify the Modifiable Third Party Code and 2) reverse engineer the Program modules that directly interface with the Modifiable Third Party Code provided that it is only for the purpose of debugging Licensee&apos;s modifications to such third party code. IBM&apos;s service and support obligations, if any, apply only to the unmodified Program.&#xA;&#xA;11. General&#xA;&#xA;a. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract.&#xA;&#xA;b. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.&#xA;&#xA;c. Licensee is prohibited from exporting the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d. Licensee authorizes International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries (and their successors and assigns, contractors and IBM Business Partners) to store and use Licensee&apos;s business contact information wherever they do business, in connection with IBM products and services, or in furtherance of IBM&apos;s business relationship with Licensee.&#xA;&#xA;e. Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other has not met its obligations under this Agreement. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve all disputes, disagreements, or claims between the parties relating to this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;f. Unless otherwise required by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation: 1) neither party will bring a legal action, regardless of form, for any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose; and 2) upon the expiration of such time limit, any such claim and all respective rights related to the claim lapse.&#xA;&#xA;g. Neither Licensee nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.&#xA;&#xA;h. No right or cause of action for any third party is created by this Agreement, nor is IBM responsible for any third party claims against Licensee, except as permitted in Subsection 8.1 (Items for Which IBM May Be Liable) above for bodily injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible personal property for which IBM is legally liable to that third party.&#xA;&#xA;i. In entering into this Agreement, neither party is relying on any representation not specified in this Agreement, including but not limited to any representation concerning: 1) the performance or function of the Program, other than as expressly warranted in Section 6 (No Warranties) above; 2) the experiences or recommendations of other parties; or 3) any results or savings that Licensee may achieve.&#xA;&#xA;j. IBM has signed agreements with certain organizations (called &quot;IBM Business Partners&quot;) to promote, market, and support certain Programs. IBM Business Partners remain independent and separate from IBM. IBM is not responsible for the actions or statements of IBM Business Partners or obligations they have to Licensee.&#xA;&#xA;k. The license and intellectual property indemnification terms of Licensee&apos;s other agreements with IBM (such as the IBM Customer Agreement) do not apply to Program licenses granted under this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;l. IBM does not warrant that any version of the Program that is formally released or made commercially available (if any) will be similar to, or compatible with, Early Release versions.&#xA;&#xA;m. Licensee may not assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, without IBM&apos;s prior written consent. Any attempt to do so is void.&#xA;&#xA;n. Any terms of this Agreement that by their nature extend beyond termination of this Agreement remain in effect until fulfilled, and apply to both parties&apos; respective successors and assignees.&#xA;&#xA;o. Both parties agree that all information exchanged is nonconfidential. If either party requires the exchange of confidential information, it will be made under a signed confidentiality agreement.&#xA;&#xA;12. Geographic Scope and Governing Law&#xA;&#xA;12.1 Governing Law&#xA;&#xA;Both parties agree to the application of the laws of the country in which Licensee obtained the Program license to govern, interpret, and enforce all of Licensee&apos;s and IBM&apos;s respective rights, duties, and obligations arising from, or relating in any manner to, the subject matter of this Agreement, without regard to conflict of law principles.&#xA;&#xA;The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply.&#xA;&#xA;12.2 Jurisdiction&#xA;&#xA;All rights, duties, and obligations are subject to the courts of the country in which Licensee obtained the Program license.&#xA;&#xA;Part 2 - Country-unique Terms&#xA;&#xA;For licenses granted in the countries specified below, the following terms replace or modify the referenced terms in Part 1. All terms in Part 1 that are not changed by these amendments remain unchanged and in effect.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM&#xA;CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation&#xA;distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are&#xA;distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos;&#xA;from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor&#xA;itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not&#xA;include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of&#xA;software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own&#xA;license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are&#xA;necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when&#xA;combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this&#xA;Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,&#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants&#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to&#xA;reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly&#xA;perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,&#xA;if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants&#xA;Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under&#xA;Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise&#xA;transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and&#xA;object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of&#xA;the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is&#xA;added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such&#xA;combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license&#xA;shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.&#xA;No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses&#xA;to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any&#xA;Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other&#xA;intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor&#xA;disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other&#xA;entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or&#xA;otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted&#xA;hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure&#xA;any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a&#xA;third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute&#xA;the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire that license&#xA;before distributing the Program.&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient&#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright&#xA;license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under&#xA;its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties&#xA;and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or&#xA;conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or&#xA;conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for&#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and&#xA;consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are&#xA;offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such&#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable&#xA;manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained&#xA;within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,&#xA;if&#xA;any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the&#xA;originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with&#xA;respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is&#xA;intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who&#xA;includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner&#xA;which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,&#xA;if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such&#xA;Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify&#xA;every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses,&#xA;damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and&#xA;other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified&#xA;Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial&#xA;Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial&#xA;product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims&#xA;or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property&#xA;infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:&#xA;a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and&#xA;b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the&#xA;Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement&#xA;negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at&#xA;its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If&#xA;that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#xA;warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are&#xA;such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the&#xA;Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other&#xA;Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a&#xA;court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the&#xA;Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN&#xA;&quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR&#xA;IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,&#xA;NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each&#xA;Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using&#xA;and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its&#xA;exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the&#xA;risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to&#xA;or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of&#xA;operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY&#xA;CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,&#xA;SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION&#xA;LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN&#xA;CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)&#xA;ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE&#xA;EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under&#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the&#xA;remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the&#xA;parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent&#xA;necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a&#xA;cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself&#xA;(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)&#xA;infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted&#xA;under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to&#xA;comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does&#xA;not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of&#xA;such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate,&#xA;Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as&#xA;reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under this Agreement&#xA;and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue&#xA;and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in&#xA;order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be&#xA;modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to&#xA;publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to&#xA;time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this&#xA;Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The&#xA;Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement&#xA;Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will&#xA;be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including&#xA;Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the&#xA;Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the&#xA;Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program&#xA;(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly&#xA;stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or&#xA;licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,&#xA;whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the&#xA;Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the&#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this&#xA;Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year&#xA;after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in&#xA;any resulting litigation.&#xA;'/>

This patent license shall apply to the combination of&#xA;the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is&#xA;added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such&#xA;combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents.

        <property name='df_LT.license' value='International License Agreement for Early Release of Programs&#xA;&#xA;Part 1 - General Terms&#xA;&#xA;BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, CLICKING ON AN &quot;ACCEPT&quot; BUTTON, OR OTHERWISE USING THE PROGRAM, LICENSEE AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND LICENSEE TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS,&#xA;&#xA;* DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, CLICK ON AN &quot;ACCEPT&quot; BUTTON, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND&#xA;&#xA;* PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED MEDIA AND DOCUMENTATION TO IBM. IF THE PROGRAM WAS DOWNLOADED, DESTROY ALL COPIES OF THE PROGRAM.&#xA;&#xA;1. Definitions&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Authorized Use&quot; - the specified level at which Licensee is authorized to execute or run the Program. That level may be measured by number of users, millions of service units (&quot;MSUs&quot;), Processor Value Units (&quot;PVUs&quot;), or other level of use specified by IBM.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Early Release&quot; - a release of a Program for purposes of testing prior to it being made commercially available that may still be under development and therefore, potentially unreliable.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;IBM&quot; - International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;License Information&quot; (&quot;LI&quot;) - a document that provides information and any additional terms specific to a Program. The Program&apos;s LI can be found in the Program&apos;s directory, by the use of a system command, or as a booklet included with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; - the following, including the original and all whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, files, and modules, 3) audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), and 4) related licensed materials (such as keys and documentation).&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Test Period&quot; - the period during which the Licensee tests a Program that has not been made commercially available to customers.&#xA;&#xA;2. Agreement Structure&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms (if any) and the LI and is the complete agreement between Licensee and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any prior oral or written communications between Licensee and IBM concerning Licensee&apos;s use of the Program. The terms of Part 2 may replace or modify those of Part 1. To the extent of any conflict, the LI prevails over both Parts.&#xA;&#xA;3. License Grant&#xA;&#xA;The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold.&#xA;&#xA;IBM grants Licensee a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable license to 1) download, install, and use the Program during the Test Period up to the Authorized Use specified in the LI solely for test purposes and to provide feedback to IBM and 2) make a backup copy, all provided that&#xA;&#xA;a. Licensee has lawfully obtained the Program and complies with the terms of this Agreement;&#xA;&#xA;b. the backup copy does not execute unless the backed-up Program cannot execute;&#xA;&#xA;c. Licensee reproduces all copyright notices and other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy, of the Program;&#xA;&#xA;d. Licensee maintains a record of all copies of the Program and ensures that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or remotely) 1) does so only on Licensee&apos;s behalf and 2) complies with the terms of this Agreement;&#xA;&#xA;e. Licensee does not 1) use the Program for productive purposes or otherwise use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, otherwise translate, or reverse engineer the Program, except as expressly permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; 3) use any of the Program&apos;s components, files, modules, audio-visual content, or related licensed materials separately from that Program; 4) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program; or 5) use the Program for commercial application hosting; and&#xA;&#xA;f. if Licensee obtains this Program as a Supporting Program, Licensee uses this Program only to support the Principal Program and subject to any limitations in the license to the Principal Program, or, if Licensee obtains this Program as a Principal Program, Licensee uses all Supporting Programs only to support this Program, and subject to any limitations in this Agreement. For purposes of this Item &quot;f,&quot; a &quot;Supporting Program&quot; is a Program that is part of another IBM Program (&quot;Principal Program&quot;) and identified as a Supporting Program in the Principal Program&apos;s LI. (To obtain a separate license to a Supporting Program without these restrictions, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained the Supporting Program.)&#xA;&#xA;This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes.&#xA;&#xA;3.1 Updates, Fixes, and Patches&#xA;&#xA;When Licensee receives an update, fix, or patch to a Program, Licensee accepts any additional or different terms that are applicable to such update, fix, or patch that are specified in its LI. If no additional or different terms are provided, then the update, fix, or patch is subject solely to this Agreement. If the Program is replaced by an update, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the replaced Program.&#xA;&#xA;3.2 Term and Termination&#xA;&#xA;The Test Period begins on the date Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement and ends upon the earliest of 1) the end of the duration or the date specified by IBM in either the License Information or a transaction document, 2) the date on which the Program automatically disables itself, or 3) the date on which IBM makes the Program commercially available. Licensee&apos;s license to the Program terminates at the end of the Test Period, and Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the Program and destroy all of Licensee&apos;s copies of the Program within 10 days of the end of the Test Period.&#xA;&#xA;IBM may terminate Licensee&apos;s license if Licensee fails to comply with the terms of this Agreement. If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of and destroy all of Licensee&apos;s copies of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;THE PROGRAM MAY CONTAIN A DISABLING DEVICE THAT WILL PREVENT IT FROM BEING USED AFTER THE TEST PERIOD ENDS. LICENSEE AGREES NOT TO TAMPER WITH THE DISABLING DEVICE OR THE PROGRAM. LICENSEE SHOULD TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT WHEN THE PROGRAM CAN NO LONGER BE USED.&#xA;&#xA;4. Charges&#xA;&#xA;There is no charge for the use of the Program for the duration of the Test Period.&#xA;&#xA;5. Rights in Data&#xA;&#xA;Licensee assigns to IBM all right, title, and interest (including ownership of copyright) in any data, suggestions, or written materials that 1) are related to the Program and 2) Licensee provides to IBM. Upon IBM&apos;s request, Licensee will sign additional documents necessary to assign such rights. In addition to the foregoing, Licensee grants to IBM a non-exclusive, irrevocable, unrestricted, worldwide and paid-up right and license to a) include in any product or service any idea, know-how, concept, technique, invention, discovery or improvement, whether or not patentable, that Licensee provides to IBM related to the Program b) use, manufacture and market any such product or service, and c) allow others to do any of the foregoing.&#xA;&#xA;6. No Warranties&#xA;&#xA;SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE PROGRAM OR SUPPORT, IF ANY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND TITLE, AND ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF NON-INFRINGEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED BY LAW. NO WARRANTIES APPLY AFTER THAT PERIOD. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. LICENSEE MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.&#xA;&#xA;THE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION 6 ALSO APPLY TO ANY OF IBM&apos;S PROGRAM DEVELOPERS AND SUPPLIERS.&#xA;&#xA;MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIERS, OR PUBLISHERS OF NON-IBM PROGRAMS MAY PROVIDE THEIR OWN WARRANTIES.&#xA;&#xA;IBM DOES NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT OF ANY KIND, UNLESS IBM SPECIFIES OTHERWISE. IN SUCH EVENT, ANY SUPPORT PROVIDED BY IBM IS SUBJECT TO THE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION 6.&#xA;&#xA;7. Licensee Data and Databases&#xA;&#xA;To assist Licensee in isolating the cause of a problem with the Program, IBM may request that Licensee 1) allow IBM to remotely access Licensee&apos;s system or 2) send Licensee information or system data to IBM. However, IBM is not obligated to provide such assistance unless IBM and Licensee enter a separate written agreement under which IBM agrees to provide to Licensee that type of support, which is beyond IBM&apos;s obligations in this Agreement. In any event, IBM uses information about errors and problems to improve its products and services, and assist with its provision of related support offerings. For these purposes, IBM may use IBM entities and subcontractors (including in one or more countries other than the one in which Licensee is located), and Licensee authorizes IBM to do so.&#xA;&#xA;Licensee remains responsible for 1) any data and the content of any database Licensee makes available to IBM, 2) the selection and implementation of procedures and controls regarding access, security, encryption, use, and transmission of data (including any personally-identifiable data), and 3) backup and recovery of any database and any stored data. Licensee will not send or provide IBM access to any personally-identifiable information, whether in data or any other form, and will be responsible for reasonable costs and other amounts that IBM may incur relating to any such information mistakenly provided to IBM or the loss or disclosure of such information by IBM, including those arising out of any third party claims.&#xA;&#xA;8. Limitation of Liability&#xA;&#xA;The limitations and exclusions in this Section 8 (Limitation of Liability) apply to the full extent they are not prohibited by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver.&#xA;&#xA;8.1 Items for Which IBM May Be Liable&#xA;&#xA;Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM&apos;s part or other liability, Licensee is entitled to recover damages from IBM. Regardless of the basis on which Licensee is entitled to claim damages from IBM (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort claim), IBM&apos;s entire liability for all claims in the aggregate arising from or related to each Program or otherwise arising under this Agreement will not exceed the amount of any 1) damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property and 2) other actual direct damages up to U.S. $10,000 (or equivalent in local currency).&#xA;&#xA;This limit also applies to any of IBM&apos;s Program developers and suppliers. It is the maximum for which IBM and its Program developers and suppliers are collectively responsible.&#xA;&#xA;8.2 Items for Which IBM Is Not Liable&#xA;&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY:&#xA;&#xA;a. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;&#xA;&#xA;b. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR&#xA;&#xA;c. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.&#xA;&#xA;9. Compliance Verification&#xA;&#xA;For purposes of this Section 9 (Compliance Verification), &quot;Early Release Program Terms&quot; means 1) this Agreement and applicable amendments and transaction documents provided by IBM, and 2) IBM software policies that may be found at the IBM Software Policy website (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), including but not limited to those policies concerning backup, sub-capacity pricing, and migration.&#xA;&#xA;The rights and obligations set forth in this Section 9 remain in effect during the period the Program is licensed to Licensee, and for two years thereafter.&#xA;&#xA;9.1 Verification Process&#xA;&#xA;Licensee agrees to create, retain, and provide to IBM and its auditors accurate written records, system tool outputs, and other system information sufficient to provide auditable verification that Licensee&apos;s use of all Programs is in compliance with the Early Release Program Terms, including, without limitation, all of IBM&apos;s applicable licensing and pricing qualification terms. Licensee is responsible for 1) ensuring that it does not exceed its Authorized Use, and 2) remaining in compliance with Early Release Program Terms.&#xA;&#xA;Upon reasonable notice, IBM may verify Licensee&apos;s compliance with Early Release Program Terms at all sites and for all environments in which Licensee uses (for any purpose) Programs subject to Early Release Program Terms. Such verification will be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee&apos;s business, and may be conducted on Licensee&apos;s premises, during normal business hours. IBM may use an independent auditor to assist with such verification, provided IBM has a written confidentiality agreement in place with such auditor.&#xA;&#xA;9.2 Resolution&#xA;&#xA;IBM will notify Licensee in writing if any such verification indicates that Licensee has used any Program in excess of its Authorized Use or is otherwise not in compliance with the Early Release Program Terms. Licensee agrees to promptly pay directly to IBM the charges that IBM specifies in an invoice for 1) any such excess use, 2) support for such excess use for the lesser of the duration of such excess use or two years, and 3) any additional charges and other liabilities determined as a result of such verification.&#xA;&#xA;10. Third Party Notices&#xA;&#xA;The Program may include third party code that IBM, not the third party, licenses to Licensee under this Agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party code (&quot;Third Party Notices&quot;) are included for Licensee&apos;s information only. These notices can be found in the Program&apos;s NOTICES file(s). Information on how to obtain source code for certain third party code can be found in the Third Party Notices. If in the Third Party Notices IBM identifies third party code as &quot;Modifiable Third Party Code,&quot; IBM authorizes Licensee to 1) modify the Modifiable Third Party Code and 2) reverse engineer the Program modules that directly interface with the Modifiable Third Party Code provided that it is only for the purpose of debugging Licensee&apos;s modifications to such third party code. IBM&apos;s service and support obligations, if any, apply only to the unmodified Program.&#xA;&#xA;11. General&#xA;&#xA;a. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract.&#xA;&#xA;b. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.&#xA;&#xA;c. Licensee is prohibited from exporting the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d. Licensee authorizes International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries (and their successors and assigns, contractors and IBM Business Partners) to store and use Licensee&apos;s business contact information wherever they do business, in connection with IBM products and services, or in furtherance of IBM&apos;s business relationship with Licensee.&#xA;&#xA;e. Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other has not met its obligations under this Agreement. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve all disputes, disagreements, or claims between the parties relating to this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;f. Unless otherwise required by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation: 1) neither party will bring a legal action, regardless of form, for any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose; and 2) upon the expiration of such time limit, any such claim and all respective rights related to the claim lapse.&#xA;&#xA;g. Neither Licensee nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.&#xA;&#xA;h. No right or cause of action for any third party is created by this Agreement, nor is IBM responsible for any third party claims against Licensee, except as permitted in Subsection 8.1 (Items for Which IBM May Be Liable) above for bodily injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible personal property for which IBM is legally liable to that third party.&#xA;&#xA;i. In entering into this Agreement, neither party is relying on any representation not specified in this Agreement, including but not limited to any representation concerning: 1) the performance or function of the Program, other than as expressly warranted in Section 6 (No Warranties) above; 2) the experiences or recommendations of other parties; or 3) any results or savings that Licensee may achieve.&#xA;&#xA;j. IBM has signed agreements with certain organizations (called &quot;IBM Business Partners&quot;) to promote, market, and support certain Programs. IBM Business Partners remain independent and separate from IBM. IBM is not responsible for the actions or statements of IBM Business Partners or obligations they have to Licensee.&#xA;&#xA;k. The license and intellectual property indemnification terms of Licensee&apos;s other agreements with IBM (such as the IBM Customer Agreement) do not apply to Program licenses granted under this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;l. IBM does not warrant that any version of the Program that is formally released or made commercially available (if any) will be similar to, or compatible with, Early Release versions.&#xA;&#xA;m. Licensee may not assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, without IBM&apos;s prior written consent. Any attempt to do so is void.&#xA;&#xA;n. Any terms of this Agreement that by their nature extend beyond termination of this Agreement remain in effect until fulfilled, and apply to both parties&apos; respective successors and assignees.&#xA;&#xA;o. Both parties agree that all information exchanged is nonconfidential. If either party requires the exchange of confidential information, it will be made under a signed confidentiality agreement.&#xA;&#xA;12. Geographic Scope and Governing Law&#xA;&#xA;12.1 Governing Law&#xA;&#xA;Both parties agree to the application of the laws of the country in which Licensee obtained the Program license to govern, interpret, and enforce all of Licensee&apos;s and IBM&apos;s respective rights, duties, and obligations arising from, or relating in any manner to, the subject matter of this Agreement, without regard to conflict of law principles.&#xA;&#xA;The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply.&#xA;&#xA;12.2 Jurisdiction&#xA;&#xA;All rights, duties, and obligations are subject to the courts of the country in which Licensee obtained the Program license.&#xA;&#xA;Part 2 - Country-unique Terms&#xA;&#xA;For licenses granted in the countries specified below, the following terms replace or modify the referenced terms in Part 1. All terms in Part 1 that are not changed by these amendments remain unchanged and in effect.

The arbitration award will be final and binding for the parties without appeal and will be in writing and set forth the findings of fact and the conclusions of law.&#xA;&#xA;The number of arbitrators will be three, with each side to the dispute being entitled to appoint one arbitrator. The two arbitrators appointed by the parties will appoint a third arbitrator who will act as chairman of the proceedings. Vacancies in the post of chairman will be filled by the president of the SIAC. Other vacancies will be filled by the respective nominating party. Proceedings will continue from the stage they were at when the vacancy occurred.&#xA;&#xA;If one of the parties refuses or otherwise fails to appoint an arbitrator within 30 days of the date the other party appoints its, the first appointed arbitrator will be the sole arbitrator, provided that the arbitrator was validly and properly appointed.&#xA;&#xA;All proceedings will be conducted, including all documents presented in such proceedings, in the English language. The English language version of this Agreement prevails over any other language version.&#xA;&#xA;(2) In the People&apos;s Republic of China:&#xA;&#xA;In case no settlement can be reached, the disputes will be submitted to China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission for arbitration according to the then effective rules of the said Arbitration Commission. The arbitration will take place in Beijing and be conducted in Chinese. The arbitration award will be final and binding on both parties. During the course of arbitration, this agreement will continue to be performed except for the part which the parties are disputing and which is undergoing arbitration.&#xA;&#xA;(3) In Indonesia:&#xA;&#xA;Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other has not met its obligations under this Agreement. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve all disputes, disagreements, or claims between the parties relating to this Agreement. Unless otherwise required by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation, i) neither party will bring a legal action, regardless of form, arising out of or related to this Agreement or any transaction under it more than two years after the cause of action arose; and ii) after such time limit, any legal action arising out of this Agreement or any transaction under it and all respective rights related to any such action lapse.&#xA;&#xA;Disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration that shall be held in Jakarta, Indonesia in accordance with the rules of Board of the Indonesian National Board of Arbitration (Badan Arbitrase Nasional Indonesia or &quot;BANI&quot;) then in effect.

The arbitration will be held in Vienna, Austria, and the official language of the proceedings will be English. The decision of the arbitrators will be final and binding upon both parties. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph 598 (2) of the Austrian Code of Civil Procedure, the parties expressly waive the application of paragraph 595 (1) figure 7 of the Code. IBM may, however, institute proceedings in a competent court in the country of installation.&#xA;&#xA;(5) In Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania:&#xA;&#xA;All disputes arising in connection with this Agreement will be finally settled in arbitration that will be held in Helsinki, Finland in accordance with the arbitration laws of Finland then in effect.
